## Description

This is a simple API for a social network application that lets users register an email and a username, add friends, post "thoughts" and add reactions to other users thoughts. Users can also delete their own thoughts, reactions, friends, and even their account if they choose.

## Installation

To use this API, download or clone the repo to your local codespace, and invoke the "npm i" command in your terminal. This will install all the necessary dependencies. From there, invoke the "npm run start command" to run the API and start adding users and thoughts. I used insomnia to test routes, but any similar application will work as well.

## Usage

This project is intended to be used by anybody looking for a simple social network API that they want to connect to a front-end. The routes can easily be reconfigured to allow for more text and everything can be connected to a front-end application.
